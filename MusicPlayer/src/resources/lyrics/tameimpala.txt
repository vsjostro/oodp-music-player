[Verse 1]
Something doesn’t feel right
That’s enough for one night
Hope ya get a warm ride[?]
There I go, blame it on the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, there’s nothing wrong
I’m only tired of all these voices
Always saying nothing lasts forever

[Chorus]
It might be time to face it
It ain’t as fun as it used to be
No
You’re going under[?]
You ain’t as young as you used to be
It might be time to face it
You’re not as cool as you used to be
No
You aren’t cool[?]
You ain’t as young as you used to be

[Post-Chorus]
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it

[Verse 2]
I’ve been lost for fun[?]
So tell me it’s not over
‘Cause I finally got something going
And suddenly
All my friends are growing up
And moving on
I must be missing something

[Pre-Chorus 2]
‘Cause I just wanna keep this dream alive
For now
Don’t they know
Nothing lasts forever?

[Chorus]
It might be time to face it
Nobody knows what you’ve come here for
No
You’re going under[?]
They only rise when you’re at the door

[Bridge]
It might be time
It might be time to face it
You may as well embrace it
The problem’s too convincing[?]
Yeah
It might be time

[Chorus]
It might be time to face it
You ain’t as fun as you used to be
You only come[?]
You ain’t as cool as you used to be

[Outro]
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it
